# Personal website
==================

I made this website using [`blogdown`](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) following the [`blogdown` book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and the very helpful [blog post by Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/blog/2020-12-new-year-new-blogdown/).

I've used the [blackburn theme](https://github.com/yoshiharuyamashita/blackburn), inspired largely by [MaÃ«lle Salmon's website](https://masalmon.eu/), where I've also learned to modify the theme.
